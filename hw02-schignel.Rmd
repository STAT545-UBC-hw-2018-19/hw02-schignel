## Overview
The following exercise explores the **gapminder** dataset using a number of tools in R. 
Below is a list of some helpful resources to refer to throughout this exercise (and in the future!):

## Preparation

### Load Packages
Note: The tidyverse package includes the dplyr package!
```{r install}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Load the data
```{r load data}
library(gapminder)
```

### Get familiar
It's always a good idea to check the data, to make sure it's loading correctly and is what you think it is.

The `head` function is a great way to do this. It returns the first 6 rows by default, or you can specify a number. Let's look at the first 10 rows:

```{r head}
head(gapminder, 10)
```

The `tail` function is the same, but starts from the bottom of the dataset:
```{r tail}
tail(gapminder, 10)
```


### Take a closer look
Let's dig deeper into `gapminder`.


####1. What type of object is it?
```{r typeof}
typeof(gapminder) 
```


####2. What is its class?
```{r class}
class(gapminder)
```
More information about this class is available [here](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0).


####3. How many columns/variables?
```{r ncol}
ncol(gapminder)
```


####4. How many rows/observations?
```{r nrow}
nrow(gapminder)
```
You could also use the `dim` function:
```{r dim}
dim(gapminder) # `dim` stands for "dimensions""
```

### A more "structured" approach
You could also use `str` function to answer many of the previous questions:
```{r str}
str(gapminder) # `str` stands for "structure"
```
Notice that `str` also includes variable names, types, and examples of the data in each. 
This approach might be good as an initial check, but could also be overwhelming if you were only interested in knowing one aspect of the data.


## Variable exploration

Let's explore how life expectancy varies across continents. 

#### Select out one of each type of variable:
```{r select}
cvsl <-select(gapminder, continent, lifeExp, pop) #Factor, #Number, and #Integer, respectively
cvsl # continents vs life expectancy
```


#### Conduct a basic `summary` of the data:
```{r summary}
summary(cvsl)
```
Here we can see that there are **5 unique classes** (factors) included in the continent variable. 

The mininum life expectancy across all continents is **22.60**, and the max is **82.60**.

The minimum population is **60,010** and the maximum population is **1,319,000,000**. 

Those are both very large ranges! Let's visualize them with a violin plot.


#### Violin plot
Use ggplot2 to generate a violin plot and overlay some jittered points:
```{r violin}
ggplot(cvsl, aes(continent, lifeExp))+
  geom_violin()+
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1)
```

Interesting, we can see that, in the data period (1952-2007), there is a fairly large range for each continent, with the exception of Oceania. In fact, Oceania is on par with Europe, and is the only continent with a life expectancy completely above 65.

Perhaps *this* is a factor?

### Filtering the data

Suppose we wanted to visualize the relationship between **Life Expectancy** and **Gross Domestic Product per capita** in Europe and Africa over the last 50 years that we have data for:

We can do this through filtering and piping the data into ggplot:

#### Filter the data

```{r piping}
select(gapminder, gdpPercap, lifeExp, pop, year, continent) %>% #subsetting data
  filter(year > 1957, continent=="Europe"|continent=="Africa") %>% #filter by criteria
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap))+ #piped to ggplot
  geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop, alpha=0.1)) + # add aesthetics 
  xlab("Life Expectancy")+
  ylab("GDP per Capita")
```

Here we can see that most people in Africa tend to live much shorter lives, with less income, than people in Europe. 

Still, we can see that this isn't a hard split. There are some clear outliers in both continents, and a fairly large overlap between the healthier, wealthier Africans and Europeans on the lower ends of the two scales.

Let's work for more overlap (preferably in the top right corner) in the next 50 years!

### Extra thoughts
Perhaps an analyst wants to filter the data just to Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed with the following code? 
```{r}
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```

While the above seems correct, it is unsuccessful because `c()` returns only data with the combination of the two countries. The correct way to do this is to use `|`.

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country=="Rwanda"|country=="Afghanistan")
```
Notice the much larger amount of data returned in the second filtering operation!
