## Overview
The following exercise explores the **gapminder** dataset using a number of tools in R. 
Below is a list of some helpful resources to refer to throughout this exercise (and in the future!):

## Preparation

### Load Packages
Note: The tidyverse package includes the dplyr package!
```{r install}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Load the data
```{r load data}
library(gapminder)
```

### Get familiar
It's always a good idea to check the data, to make sure it's loading correctly and is what you think it is.

The `head` function is a great way to do this. It returns the first 6 rows by default, or you can specify a number. Let's look at the first 10 rows:

```{r head}
head(gapminder, 10)
```

The `tail` function is the same, but starts from the bottom of the dataset:
```{r tail}
tail(gapminder, 10)
```


### Take a closer look
Let's dig deeper into `gapminder`.


####1. What type of object is it?
```{r typeof}
typeof(gapminder) 
```


####2. What is its class?
```{r class}
class(gapminder)
```
More information about this class is available [here](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0).


####3. How many columns/variables?
```{r ncol}
ncol(gapminder)
```


####4. How many rows/observations?
```{r nrow}
nrow(gapminder)
```
You could also use the `dim` function:
```{r dim}
dim(gapminder) # `dim` stands for "dimensions""
```

### A more "structured" approach
You could also use `str` function to answer many of the previous questions:
```{r str}
str(gapminder) # `str` stands for "structure"
```
Notice that `str` also includes variable names, types, and examples of the data in each. 
This approach might be good as an initial check, but could also be overwhelming if you were only interested in knowing one aspect of the data.


## Variable exploration

Let's explore how life expectancy varies across continents. 

#### Select out one of each type of variable:
```{r select}
cvsl <-select(gapminder, continent, lifeExp, pop) #Factor, #Number, and #Integer, respectively
cvsl # continents vs life expactancy
```


#### Conduct a basic `summary` of the data:
```{r summary}
summary(cvsl)
```
Here we can see that there are **5 unique classes** (factors) included in the continent variable. 

The mininum life expectancy across all continents is **22.60**, and the max is **82.60**.

The minimum population is **60,010** and the maximum population is **1,319,000,000**. 

Those are both very large ranges! Let's visualize them with a violin plot.


#### Violin plot
Use ggplot2 to generate a violin plot and overlay some jittered points:
```{r violin}
ggplot(cvsl, aes(continent, lifeExp))+
  geom_violin()+
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1)
```

Interesting, we can see that, in the data period (1952-2007), there is a fairly large range for each continent, with the exception of Oceania. In fact, Oceania is on par with Europe, and is the only continent with a life expectancy completely above 65.

I wonder if this has anything to do with it?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Summarize the cars dataset
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
